<h1 style="color:red;>MY NAME IS ARIELLA KHALILI</h1>
<p>I am going  to be a junior this year and there is nothing I am more nervous for.<br> I am one of five and was born in a very lame year, 2001. Literally the most lame lame year ever.<br> I currently live in long island but im not going to go more specific than that becuase my parents woulld kill me if i leak my information. they are over protective and would kill me if they ever found this. I dont even have a Facebook.<br> I had an adventure yesterday.  Oh yea Girls who code is a program im in and i met a firend there. so we went to macys and then tried on dresses and it was so fun. and i got home late cause i lied to them, the killers of fun... the parents. </p>
 <h3> Likes and Dislikes</h3>
 <p> I like coding but don't tell people.<br>
  I like things, but pitcures that domument life as they are or things as they are<br>
   I know music, probably.<br>
   DISLIKES<br>
   i dont like waking up and being limited <br>
   i dont like explaining bcause i suck at it.<p/>
  <p> python is basically scratch but more complex and real. scratch is made in a way that kids can understand. they have some same things, such as, same actions and such.  it was really fustrating when i had a problem but when i fixed it, it was so relieving </p>
<h3>Fun facts<h3/>
