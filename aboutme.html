<h1>MY NAME IS ARIELLA KHALILI</h1>
<p>I am going  to be a junior this year and there is nothing I am more nervous for.<br> I am one of five and was born in a very lame year, 2001. Literally the most lame lame year ever.<br> I currently live in long island but im not going to go more specific than that becuase my parents woulld kill me if i leak my information. they are over protective and would kill me if they ever found this. I dont even have a Facebook.<br> I had an adventure yesterday.  Oh yea Girls who code is a program im in and i met a firend there. so we went to macys and then tried on dresses and it was so fun. and i got home late cause i lied to them, the killers of fun... the parents. </p>
